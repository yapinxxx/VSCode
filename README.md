1.  We don't need to create tasks.json, launch.json, c_cpp_properties.json,

    but if your OS is Windows, you have to revise launch.json from LLDB to GDB, or you can't debug.
    
2.  tasks.json is to control the compiler, launch.json is to control the debugger, c_cpp_properties.json is to help intellisense.

3.  If the path have Taiwanese word might have some problem.
