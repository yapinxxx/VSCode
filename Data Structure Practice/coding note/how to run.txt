1.	We need to build the executable,

	so we set the tasks.json,

	tasks.json will choose the compiler,

	and name this active.


2.	We want to launch, so we create the launch.json,

	launch will choose the debugger, and find the build,

	if name wrong it won't work.


3.	c_cpp_properties.json it will tell the program,

	where is the library, you also can merge the library,

	but it will look ugly.

	
	However, it is very convienence.


4.	If you want to compile the C++ program,

	you have to use clang-cpp.exe, not clang.exe

	or you will get the wrong message.
